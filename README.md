# Inspiration
The 4 of us came with a motive to develop something that will help the people boost their self-confidence. Reading about how Technology helped kids with Autism improve was so enduring and inspiring! Beating stage fear and social awkwardness is a rising issue in today's society and introverts' battles are just flooding with the growing social media!

# What it does
Record/Upload your video speaking(for some occasion like say debate, interview or funeral).
IEA will analyze your expressions and vocal tone describing you on how are you are being perceived by others.
The recommendation model drives you to the YouTube link to improve the aspect of expressing.
You Live & Learn! :)

# How we built it
Front End: HTML/CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, High charts
Backend: C#, Microsoft Cognitive Services API (Video Indexer API, Face API), Google-YouTube recommendations API hosted on Microsft Azure.
AGILE!

# Challenges we ran into
We had to Analyze the video emotions frame by frame since there was no API to analyze the tone of the video as a whole.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
4 People with no common background, brainstorming and delivering a working model in a limited timeframe was challenging but fun!

# What we learned
Microsoft Azure Cloud Services, Cognitive Services APIs.
